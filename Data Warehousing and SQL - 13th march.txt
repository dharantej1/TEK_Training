====== Industry Revolution ======
Industry 1.0 - Steam Engines
Industry 2.0 - Electrification
Industry 3.0 - Information Age(semi conductors and computer), 
	       interface between human and machine
Industry 4.0 - Intelligence Age
	       	- Data Engineering - managing the data
		- Data Science - to get hidden insights from the data
		- Machine Learning - subset of AI which reads the data and analyses the
				     data and make predictions based on the previous knowledge
		- IOT - Internet of Things
		- Block Chain - protecting the data using various techniques
		- Cloud - Cloud services

====== Data Engineer ======
1. Data Ingestion - Scoop, Kafka
2. Data lack - storage
3. Transformation - pre-process data in usable form
4. Data Warehouse - Data is more sorted and stored
5. Exploration for data analysis 
6. Data Science 
7. Data Management

====== Data Pre-processing: ======
1. Missing values : replace by central tendency
		- continuous values - mean
		- discrete - median/ mean
		- categorical - mode

2. Duplicate values : remove the duplicate values (drop)

3. Outliers : if they are less in number:
			remove / drop the values
	      if they are large in number:
			replace them with the central tendency

4. ETL : Extract Transform Load 

====== Data Science - Discriptive Analysis ======
(we use statistics here, what has happened?)
1. Data Mining
	- Data cleaning
	- Data manipulation (data wrangling - apply data to preprocess duplicate entries, unwanted elements
			in the data set, etc)
	- Data preprocessing (if the data is of catrgorical type we apply label encoding to convert it into numerical data)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (analysis using visualization of the data)
	- Past analysis of the data 
	- Statistical (descriptive statistics analysis)
		- boxplot, histogram, plot, density plot (KDE - kernel density estimator)
3. Data analysis
	- Machine learning (gives out the rules when the input data set is given)
		- Update/ Upgrade
		- Experience
		- Performance


====== Business Intelligence ======
acts transforming raw/ operation data into useful information for business analysis
Planning => Data gathering => Data analysis => Business actions
(MISSED FEW TOPICS)
KAFKA can read the data directly from the web/ IP Address


====== Data Warehouse (Structured Data) ======
(where as the Data Lake is unstructured data format)
- Data Warehouse works on the concept of data mart(one particular service)


SCALING is of two types - 	Horizontal scaling - Increasing the servers
				Vertical scaling - Updating the resources of a particular server


OLTP RDBMS - (Online Transaction Processing) that captures, stores and process data from transaction
OLAP Data warehouse - (Online Analytical Prosessing) use complex query to analyse aggregate historical data from OLTP
