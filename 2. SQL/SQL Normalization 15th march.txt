====== Normalization ======
- Database normalization is a database schema design technique, by which an existing schema is modified to 
- minimize redundancy and dependency of data.
- normalization is used to reduce the data redundancy

====== Anomalies in Normalization: ======
- - Insertion anomaly
- - Updation anamoly
- - Deletion anamoly

====== Normal Forms ======
1. 1NF
2. 2NF
3. 3NF
4. BCNF

1. 1NF: - every attribute is a single valued attribute (or) doesnot contain multivalued attributes (or) composite attributes
	- every attribute must be atomic

2. 2NF: - has to follow 1NF
	- there should be no partial dependencies (which means that there should not be two primary keys)

3. 3NF: - has to follow 2NF
	- should not have transitive dependency (A->B, B->C then A->C must not be present in the tables which happens to be transitive realtion) 

4. BCNF: - advanced version of 3NF
	 - must be in the 3rd NF 
	 - for every non trivial functional dependency X->Y, X is the super key of the table. that means X cant be a non prime attribute and Y is the prime attribute
