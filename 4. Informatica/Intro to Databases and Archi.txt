There are 13 Codd Rules from 0 -12 which define which database is relational and which is not
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/e-f-codd-s-12-rules-for-rdbms

			DBMS					|		RDBMS
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
DBMS is a stand-alone - works only on stand alone environments		RDBMS is a logical one.
Its not in the network, it cant be shared				
Its not a client server architecture, because it cant be shared
Its not involved with the project development process
not safe and secure	

Data model is required for understanding the data. 
Data model is always open-type

Data Base works on Normalization 
Data Warehouse works on De-Normalization

Never say Data warehouse has a parent-child dependency

Data warehouse is like - You name it, You do it. Its also flexible 
But this is not the same for the Database

Data mart is the smaller version of the Data warehouse (for exmaple we can make a separate data waehouse for each department of the company)
Data marts can be connected (combined) 

-- -- -- -- CONFIRM DIMENSION is a dimension that connects the data marts 

====== IMPORTANT TOPICS ======
Meta data 
ODS - operational data store - based on the operational system (current business)
staging
Data mart

====== ANATOMY OF QUERY ======

select * from table_name;

select - command
from "select" to "from" - select list


where - filtering process


------
Metadata is called as Repository in Informatica

Informatica is purely fromt end
So the informatica alone is incapable of storing the data
It needs the support of RDBMS for that use

rep file in the informatica contains the script files about the tables loaded into it


SCHEMA is the collection of related objects stored in a specific account

Repository manager and the Administrator manager are meant only for the Admin to access.

We need 	1. Source
		2. Target 
		3. Rep (Informatica Repository(Meta Data of the Informatica))

Informatica has one prob:	Unless it completes the job, it will not show whats the problem in the job



Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services - IICS is the cloud version of Informatica

Data model is moved to Dimension model by the system architect, which means star schema (fact and dimension tables are already created by the architect)
One fact table and multiple dimension tables can be created (max of 15 dimension tables can be ok!, more than that it creates the performance issues!)

we need to import the data from the DataBase to the Informatica as Informatica is only the front-end part

Lifecycle product: we cant show the product in the middle of the process
Data Base, Data Base is a lifecycle product but
Python is not a lifecycle product

Data Warehouse is also a RDBMS Package

If you are using the terminology - fact and dimension - you are talking about data warehousing
If you are using the terminology - tables - you are talking about the data base

DSS - Decision Support System (used by the company to analyse the trends)
Data warehouse is used by DSS 
Day-to-Day transactions - Operational Systems

Granularity/ Grain - tells you at what level the work has to be done
			- if you want to do the analysis on hourly basis - Granuarity is Hours
			- if you want to do the analysis on daily basis - Granularity is Days
- This is time levely Granularity

- One more Granularity is Region wise Granularity

- Log files are generate if its client-server architecture

- Foreign key tables are not unique

	- Transactional data				- aggregate data		- Aggregated data
	- Optimized for transaction response time	- cleanse data			- Historical data
	- current					- consolidate data
	- normalized or de-normalized data		- de-normalize data
							- apply business rules

====== Execution of SQL statements ======

select statements triggers 3 processes: 	parsing ---> execution ---> fetching

DML connands does only 2 processes: 		parsing ---> execution

	parsing: it checks syntax, checks whether the table is yours or not, spell checks, authentications, authorizations
	- all this process is validated with the metadata

	fetching: process occurs with the help of implicit cursor (also explicit cursor exists)

------ WorkFlow:

1. Query

2. Parsing with the help of metadata
	syntax check , authorization, authentication, objects references, attributes references, column references, spell checks

3. Execution in the memory (cache, buffer)

4. Fetching with the help of cursors



Source Qualifier is the Native Data type of the informatica in the Mapping part of the Mapper
