			DBMS					|		RDBMS
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
DBMS is a stand-alone - works only on stand alone environments		RDBMS is a logical one.
Its not in the network, it cant be shared				
Its not a client server architecture, because it cant be shared
Its not involved with the project development process
not safe and secure	

Data model is required for understanding the data. 
Data model is always open-type

Data Base works on Normalization 
Data Warehouse works on De-Normalization

Never say Data warehouse has a parent-child dependency

Data warehouse is like - You name it, You do it. Its also flexible 
But this is not the same for the Database

Data mart is the smaller version of the Data warehouse (for exmaple we can make a separate data waehouse for each department of the company)
Data marts can be connected (combined) 

-- -- -- -- CONFIRM DIMENSION is a dimension that connects the data marts 

====== IMPORTANT TOPICS ======
Meta data 
ODS - operational data store - based on the operational system (current business)
staging
Data mart

====== ANATOMY OF QUERY ======

select * from table_name;

select - command
from select to from - select list


where - filtering process

Metadata is called as Repository in Informatica

Informatica is purely fromt end
So the informatica alone is incapable of storing the data
It needs the support of RDBMS for that use

rep file in the informatica contains the script files about the tables loaded into it


SCHEMA is the collection of related objects stored in a specific account

Repository manager and the Administrator manager are meant only for the Admin to access.

We need 	1. Source
		2. Target 
		3. Rep (Informatica Repository(Meta Data of the Informatica))

Informatica has one prob:	Unless it completes the job, it will not show whats the problem in the job



Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services - IICS is the cloud version of Informatica

Data model is moved to Dimension model by the system architect, which means star schema (fact and dimension tables are already created by the architect)
One fact table and multiple dimension tables can be created (max of 15 dimension tables can be ok!, more than that it creates the performance issues!)

we need to import the data from the DataBase to the Informatica as the Informatica is the
