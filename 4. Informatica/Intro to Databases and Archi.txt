There are 13 Codd Rules from 0 -12 which define which database is relational and which is not
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/e-f-codd-s-12-rules-for-rdbms

			DBMS					|		RDBMS
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
DBMS is a stand-alone - works only on stand alone environments		RDBMS is a logical one.
Its not in the network, it cant be shared				
Its not a client server architecture, because it cant be shared
Its not involved with the project development process
not safe and secure	

Data model is required for understanding the data. 
Data model is always open-type

Data Base works on Normalization 
Data Warehouse works on De-Normalization

Never say Data warehouse has a parent-child dependency

Data warehouse is like - You name it, You do it. Its also flexible 
But this is not the same for the Database

Data mart is the smaller version of the Data warehouse (for exmaple we can make a separate data waehouse for each department of the company)
Data marts can be connected (combined) 

-- -- -- -- CONFIRM DIMENSION is a dimension that connects the data marts 

====== IMPORTANT TOPICS ======
Meta data 
ODS - operational data store - based on the operational system (current business)
staging
Data mart

====== ANATOMY OF QUERY ======

select * from table_name;

select - command
from "select" to "from" - select list


where - filtering process


------
Metadata is called as Repository in Informatica

Informatica is purely fromt end
So the informatica alone is incapable of storing the data
It needs the support of RDBMS for that use

rep file in the informatica contains the script files about the tables loaded into it


SCHEMA is the collection of related objects stored in a specific account

Repository manager and the Administrator manager are meant only for the Admin to access.

We need 	1. Source
		2. Target 
		3. Rep (Informatica Repository(Meta Data of the Informatica))

Informatica has one prob:	Unless it completes the job, it will not show whats the problem in the job



Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services - IICS is the cloud version of Informatica

Data model is moved to Dimension model by the system architect, which means star schema (fact and dimension tables are already created by the architect)
One fact table and multiple dimension tables can be created (max of 15 dimension tables can be ok!, more than that it creates the performance issues!)

we need to import the data from the DataBase to the Informatica as Informatica is only the front-end part

Lifecycle product: we cant show the product in the middle of the process
Data Base, Data Base is a lifecycle product but
Python is not a lifecycle product

Data Warehouse is also a RDBMS Package

If you are using the terminology - fact and dimension - you are talking about data warehousing
If you are using the terminology - tables - you are talking about the data base

DSS - Decision Support System (used by the company to analyse the trends)
Data warehouse is used by DSS 
Day-to-Day transactions - Operational Systems

Granularity/ Grain - tells you at what level the work has to be done
			- if you want to do the analysis on hourly basis - Granuarity is Hours
			- if you want to do the analysis on daily basis - Granularity is Days
- This is time levely Granularity

- One more Granularity is Region wise Granularity

- Log files are generate if its client-server architecture

- Foreign key tables are not unique

====== Execution of SQL statements ======

select statements triggers 3 processes: 	parsing ---> execution ---> fetching

DML connands does only 2 processes: 		parsing ---> execution

	parsing: it checks syntax, checks whether the table is yours or not, spell checks, authentications, authorizations
	- all this process is validated with the metadata

	fetching: process occurs with the help of implicit cursor (also explicit cursor exists)

------ WorkFlow:

1. Query

2. Parsing with the help of metadata
	syntax check , authorization, authentication, objects references, attributes references, column references, spell checks

3. Execution in the memory (cache, buffer)

4. Fetching with the help of cursors



Source Qualifier is the Native Data type of the informatica in the Mapping part of the Mapper




====== 3rd April 2023 ======

- data model is for data base
- you get physical tables after getting the data into the logical design
- data model refers to database
- dimension model refers to data ware house
- Inmon theory roff Kimball theory use these two theories for the designing the data warehouse

-- The Kimball Design:
----------------------------------------
	1. select business process - awareness about the cost, revenue and sales
	2. declare the grain - granularity (level of analysis what you expect from the client) (granularity might change)
	3. choose dimension - when execution starts first we create the dimensions, not the facts
	4. identify facts (metrics) - first phase of analysis happens on the facts

- facts are the summarized information stored in the star schema under data mart
	- a data mart can consist of one star schema or multiple star schema (constellation)
	
- dimensions are the descriptive in nature, which is a part of star schema.


-- Interview Question:	Is the data coming directly coming from the database goes and sits in the data warehouse?
-- Answer:	the dimension data should not have the redundant data which the data might have, so we should do the lookup transformation to the data 
		(time dimension(date and time) will be the part of the lookup) the if there no matches with the desired target then it moves to the 
		data warehouse

- when ever you are using an aggregate information, that means there is redundant data in the database or data warehouse

-- The Inmon Model (talks about the Enterprise Data Warehouse)
-------------------------------------------------
- Consists of all databases and information systems in organization (CIF - Corporate Information Factory)

- Defines overall database environment as:
	1. Operational
	2. Atomic data warehouse
	3. Departmental
	4. Individual
- The Warehouse is part of the bigger whole (CIF)



-- Bill Inmon Model: Top-Down
---------------------------------------
- Recommends  big Centralized enterprise data warehouse where all available data from transaction systems are consolidated into....

- a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data into DSS... then data marts are built for analyticÂ needs of depts

- Uses ER model to organize the data in enterprise data warehouse

- Inmon gives his opinion of Dependent data marts

- More Complex, Expensive & Longer to Deliver


-- Data warehouse is a multi-dimensional architecture (not physically, logically)
-- Fact table is connected to a multiple dimensions (which means the fact table sees them in those number of ways or those number of prespectives)


- BI contains many start-schemas of Facts and Dimensions and all the possible combinations can be collectively called as the Data Marts

       +-------------+
       |    BI       |
       |             |

               |
       +-------------+
       |  Data Marts |
       +-------------+

- Fact doesnot have any presence without the dimension table, so we build the dimension table first

- Confirm Dimension: contains two Data Marts, which means it connects two different Data Marts based on the necessacity

- SnowFlake schema is the extension of the dimension
        +----------------+
        |   Fact Table   |
        |                |
        |    (Measures)  |
        +----------------+
                |
                | has
                |
        +----------------+
        |  Dimension 1   |
        |                |
        |    (Attribute) |
        +--------+-------+
                 |
                 | has
                 |
        +--------+-------+
        |  Dimension 2   |
        |                |
        |    (Attribute) |
        +----------------+


- NOTE: We should not design too many SnowFlake schemas as it moves away from the sense of Data Warehousing, then its not a pure Data Warehousing.
