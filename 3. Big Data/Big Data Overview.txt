====== Big Data Overview ======
- Data that has high volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value
- examples: manufacturing, 
	    customers, 
	    technology, 
	    banking, 
	    healthcare, 
	    energy

- Structured Data: Data will be following some format, with data arranged in the form of tables

- Semi-Structured: Data will have some format but there is no common format
-- json: key, value pairs
-- xml: tags
-- csv: comma separated values
-- big data file formats: parquet, AVRO, ORC

- Unstructured: there is no structured format
-- video, audio, images, flatfiles, signals, pdf, worddocs

- Quasi-Structured Data: Clickstream data

====== Big Data Analytics Pipeline ======
1. Data Ingestion: migrate data from one stored location to another location

Tool 1: 
	- SQOOP: (SQL to Hadoop) migrate data from structured storage to Hadoop (HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System)
	- bidirectional tool
			
					(Storage of Hadoop)
		import->
	[DBMS]	<====>	[SQL]	<====>	[HDFS]	(Data Lake)
	      <-export
	(source)			(destination)
    - MySQL, 
    - SQlite, 
    - OracleDB

====== Components of HADOOP Ecosystem ======

Tool 2:
	- flume: in flume.comfig file we configure 
				- source (IP Address)
				- sink (HDFS - Destination)
				- channel 
	- ingestion of stream data from source (twitter, ip address, or any live stream)
	- 

2. Data Collection Layer: Temporary storage within the tools like KAFKA during the data ingestion from another sources

3. Data Storage Layer: Permanent storage layer
			- they contain: 
				- S3
				- HDFS
				- Gluster FS(File System)

4. Data Processing Layer: This contains:
				- Batch Processing (like SQL Queries) (Hive, SPARK, PIG - use map-reduce methodologies)
				- Stream Processing (data generated from live source like SPARK)
				- Hybrid Processing

5. Data Query Layer: SPARK SQL, Presto, Amazon REDSHIFT, HIVE
			
6. Analytics Engine: this contains:
				- Statistical Analysis
				- Semantic Analysis
				- Predictive Modeling
				- Text Analysis
				(we do these analysis with the help of few programming languages like:
					- Python
					- Java
					- Scala
					- MLlib (provided by SPARK)
				)

7. Data Visualization Layer: Real-time Dashboard like
				- powerBI (Azure)
				- Tableau
